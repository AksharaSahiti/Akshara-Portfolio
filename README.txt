ðŸ’¼ Akshara Sahiti â€“ Business Analyst Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website where Iâ€™ve highlighted some of the key projects Iâ€™ve worked on as a Business Analyst. It includes dashboards, data stories, and real-world problem-solving using tools like Power BI, SQL, Excel, and Tableau.

The goal of this portfolio is to showcase how I turn business data into meaningful insights that drive decisions. Youâ€™ll also find my resume and contact information here if you'd like to connect or collaborate.
